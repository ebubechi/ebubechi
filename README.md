**`Digital alchemist (Developer/Content Creator)`**


Hello, my name is Uzochukwu Ebubechukwu. I am a developer and technopreneur with a passion for creating innovative solutions. 

I have a wealth of experience in web and mobile development and system administration. Feel free to ask me anything related to these topics.

I am learning:
 - Flutter ðŸ’™ (state management, dependency inversion, routing navigation 2.0 API and animations)
 - Saas( Firebase, Superbase, and Appwrite)
 - expanding my knowledge on the backend by learning Golang (go fiber).

When developing coding projects, I use a systematic approach to ensure a successful outcome. This approach involves a combination of innovative planning, thoughtful design, and thorough implementation, all of which are essential to solving real-life problems and creating effective solutions. By following this process, I can ensure that my projects are not only functional but also efficient and user-friendly.

Fun fact about me: I love video games.

  <summary><h1> Ebubechi's Journey <h1/></summary>
From a young age, I had a strong interest in technology. This led me to pursue a degree in electronic engineering in college. However, as I progressed through my studies, I realized that my true passion lay in web and mobile development.

I began to explore this field on my own time, taking online courses and building small projects to hone my skills. After graduation, I decided to pivot my career path and pursue a role as a web and mobile developer.

The transition was not easy, but I was determined to succeed. I immersed myself in the world of coding, spending countless hours learning new languages and frameworks. I also sought out mentorship and guidance from experienced developers in the industry.

Through hard work and dedication, I was able to land my first job as a junior developer. Since then, I have continued to grow and develop my skills, taking on increasingly complex projects and expanding my knowledge base.

Looking back on my journey, I am grateful for the opportunities that have come my way and proud of the progress I have made. As I continue to advance in my career, I am excited to see where this path will take me and what new challenges I will face.
